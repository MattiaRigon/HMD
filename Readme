### Cheffy

Cheffy is a human-machine dialogue system designed to assist users in selecting and preparing recipes. Inspired by the traditional Italian family recipe book, Cheffy modernizes this concept by allowing users to browse and choose from a curated collection of trusted recipes. Users can ask Cheffy what to cook based on available ingredients, request recipes from specific cuisines, or receive step-by-step cooking instructions. Future enhancements may include integration with recipe websites, making dish discovery even more intuitive.
