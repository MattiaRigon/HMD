        "strInstructions": "STEP 1\r\nTO MAKE SUSHI ROLLS: Pat out some rice. Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\nSpread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\nAdd the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings \u2013 here we\u2019ve used tuna and cucumber.\r\n\r\nSTEP 4\r\nRoll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.\r\n\r\nSTEP 5\r\nStick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.\r\n\r\nSTEP 6\r\nWrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 7\r\nTO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 8\r\nCover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.\r\n\r\nSTEP 9\r\nTip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 10\r\nTO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.\r\n\r\nSTEP 11\r\nMake into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.",

        "strInstructions": "Pick through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3 times, drain, and set aside.  Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a solid block that you\u2019ll have to break up later\r\nIn a large pot over medium-high heat, saut\u00e9 the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.\r\nAdd the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin, paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt. Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week.",
